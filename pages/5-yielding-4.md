# Thread Yielding
No Loops?

What about non-looping tasks? There are still benefits!

- Makes the function async
- Allows browser to take control and clean up task queues

<!--
- makes function async which is handled like promises as microtask
- if it's been a while, it can yield and clean up, paint, etc
-->
