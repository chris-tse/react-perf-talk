# Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
Measuring INP

<div class="flex justify-center h-full">
  <img src="../images/inp-breakdown.svg"/>
</div>

<!--
- we generally check INP using the performance tab in the dev tools
- basic structure of tasks in the performance panel
- input delay
  - how long it takes from input to when the handler actually runs
  - same metric that FID used to use, except for all interactions, not just the first
- processing time
  - actual running time of handler itself
- presentation delay
  - style calculations
  - painting pixels
