# Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
What is it?

A metric of how <span class="underline underline-2 italic">responsive</span> a website feels to use 


- Types of interactions measured:
  - 🖱️ Clicking with a mouse
  - 👉 Tapping on a device with a touchscreen
  - ⌨️ Pressing a key on either a physical or onscreen keyboard
- Replaced First Input Delay (FID) in Core Web Vitals

<!--
- puts a number to how responsive or sluggish a website feels to use
- measures 2 kinds of interaction, click and type
- used to be FID, got replaced earlier this year with INP
- for good reason, gives a better reading on the performance of a website overall
so how exactly is INP measured?
